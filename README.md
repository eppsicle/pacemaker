# The Pacemaker 1.0

The Pacemaker 1.0 is heart-themed additive synthesis patch that allows the user to adjust settings on four different oscillators—including oscillator types, filter types, ADSR graphs, note duration, pulse width modulation and more—in order to create their own custom synth.

The Pacemaker 1.0 also features a pattern sequencer with 32 eighth notes that users can adjust to create their own note patterns, as well as two preset boxes that allow you to save synth setting and sequence settings.

Recalling the image of a heart monitor, the patch also features spectroscopes on the righthand side that visualize the shape of the synth.
